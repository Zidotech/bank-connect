- Securely connect their bank accounts
- View account balances and transactions
- Manage multiple banking connections
- Monitor financial activities in real-time

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo
- **Routing**: Expo Router (file-based routing)
- **Data Management**: Zustand
- **API Integration**: RESTful APIs with secure banking providers

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
